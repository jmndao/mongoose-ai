# Database Scaling Guide

## Overview

mongoose-ai is designed to scale with your application, but different operations scale differently. This guide outlines performance characteristics and optimization strategies for various database sizes.

## Performance Characteristics

### AI Processing (Document Creation)

- **Scales perfectly** - processing time remains constant regardless of database size
- **Independent operations** - each document processes in isolation
- **Consistent performance** - ~1.5 seconds per document whether you have 100 or 1 million documents
- **Memory efficient** - minimal memory footprint per operation

### Semantic Search (Document Querying)

- **Performance degrades** with database size using default implementation
- **Memory intensive** - loads all documents with embeddings for similarity calculation
- **Critical scaling point** - optimization required beyond 10,000 documents

## Scaling Thresholds

### Small Scale (< 10,000 documents)

- **Status**: Excellent performance out-of-the-box
- **Search time**: < 200ms
- **Memory usage**: < 100MB
- **Action required**: None

### Medium Scale (10,000 - 100,000 documents)

- **Status**: Performance degradation begins
- **Search time**: 1-5 seconds
- **Memory usage**: 500MB - 2GB
- **Optimization needed**:
  - Database indexing
  - Search result caching
  - Query pagination
  - Read replicas

### Large Scale (100,000 - 1,000,000 documents)

- **Status**: Significant performance issues
- **Search time**: 10+ seconds
- **Memory usage**: 5GB+
- **Solutions required**:
  - MongoDB Atlas Vector Search
  - Background AI processing
  - Advanced caching strategies
  - Infrastructure scaling

### Enterprise Scale (1,000,000+ documents)

- **Status**: Requires architecture changes
- **Search time**: Unusable without optimization
- **Memory usage**: Exceeds reasonable limits
- **Architecture needed**:
  - Dedicated vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate)
  - Microservice separation
  - Distributed processing
  - Enterprise infrastructure

## Optimization Strategies

### Database Level

- **Indexing**: Create indexes on AI-generated fields and search filters
- **Partial indexes**: Index only documents with embeddings
- **Compound indexes**: Optimize for filtered search patterns
- **Sharding**: Distribute data across multiple servers for massive datasets

### Application Level

- **Result caching**: Cache frequent search queries
- **Pagination**: Limit result sets and implement pagination
- **Background processing**: Generate embeddings asynchronously
- **Connection pooling**: Optimize database connections

### Infrastructure Level

- **Read replicas**: Separate read and write operations
- **Vector databases**: Dedicated infrastructure for similarity search
- **CDN caching**: Cache search results at edge locations
- **Load balancing**: Distribute search load across multiple instances

## Migration Paths

### Phase 1: Optimization (10K-100K docs)

1. Add database indexes
2. Implement caching layer
3. Optimize query patterns
4. Monitor performance metrics

### Phase 2: Vector Search (100K-1M docs)

1. Evaluate MongoDB Atlas Vector Search
2. Implement hybrid storage approach
3. Migrate search operations gradually
4. Maintain backward compatibility

### Phase 3: Dedicated Infrastructure (1M+ docs)

1. Deploy dedicated vector database
2. Implement microservice architecture
3. Separate AI processing pipeline
4. Enterprise monitoring and alerting

## Cost Implications

| Database Size | Monthly AI Costs | Infrastructure Costs | Search Performance      |
| ------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 10K docs      | $16              | $0                   | Excellent               |
| 100K docs     | $160             | $50                  | Good with optimization  |
| 1M docs       | $1,600           | $500                 | Requires vector DB      |
| 10M docs      | $16,000          | $2,000               | Enterprise architecture |

_Note: AI processing costs scale linearly, while infrastructure investments maintain performance._

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Track

- **Search response time** - Alert if > 1 second
- **Memory usage** - Monitor heap size during searches
- **Database query time** - Track MongoDB operation duration
- **AI processing queue** - Monitor background job completion
- **Error rates** - Track failed AI generations and searches

### Performance Indicators

- Search time increasing linearly with database growth
- Memory usage spikes during search operations
- Increased database connection wait times
- Higher error rates for timeout-related failures
